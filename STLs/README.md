Print with tool holders with ABS for flexability and strength with enough walls to make them solid through the bendy part.

The "Tool Release Button Enclosure body" has the tool release text debossed into it very slightly. If you have a multi-color 3D printer you can paint that debossed surface to get that text to show up.

The "T-Slot with M6 Nut" is meant to have an M6 nut encased inside the print. Set a pause just below the layers that would cover the nut and insert the nuts during the pause.
